# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C++. It supports two modes: Player vs Player and Computer vs Player.

## Modes

### Player vs Player

In this mode, two players can take turns to play the game. Player 1 is typically 'X', and Player 2 is 'O'. The game continues until one of the players wins or the game ends in a draw.

To play in this mode, run the program and follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves.

### Computer vs Player

In this mode, a single player competes against the computer. The player is 'X', and the computer is 'O'. The player makes their moves, and the computer's moves are determined by a simple algorithm.

To play in this mode, run the program and follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves against the computer.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the C++ source files using the C++ compiler, for example:
   
   ```bash
   g++ -o tictactoe main.cpp tictactoe.cpp
Now run the compiled execution using below cammand
 ./tictactoe
